# Boston-Housing-Data
This repository contains an analysis of the Boston Housing Dataset, which is commonly used in regression and machine learning tasks. The dataset includes housing prices and various influencing factors from Boston's neighborhoods in the 1970s, and has been extensively used to demonstrate how different variables can predict house prices.
Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 506 observations of Boston housing data with 14 features including:

- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river, 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: Proportion of African-Americans by town
- LSTAT: Percentage of lower-status population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s)


Project Structure
Data Exploration & Visualization: Initial exploration and visualization to understand data distribution, outliers, and correlations between features.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Modeling: Applying regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict housing prices.
Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
